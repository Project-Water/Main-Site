        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Project Water, every penny counts. For every $15,000 we raise, a clean water well can be built in a developing village in Africa. All money for the well will be donated through World Vision, one of the leading humanitarian organizations around the world. For more info on World Vision, feel free to check out their financial stewardship page <a href="http://goo.gl/R1Ue96" target="_blank">here</a>. Thank you for helping Project Water lead change across the world!
