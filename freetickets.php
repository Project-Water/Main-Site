        <p>$30. That's the price/player for NA's 2016 dodgeball tournaments. Here's what that gets you:
            <ul>
                <li>All day or night access pass</li>
                <li>An exclusive team t-shirt for every player</li>
                <li>Pizza, snacks, and drinks for every player</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>With this year's tournaments, it's our goal to get 100% of our profit to World Vision. They use our donation to develop clean water wells in underdeveloped villages in Africa. You can learn more about them <a href="http://goo.gl/R1Ue96" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

<p>Anyways, keeping costs down isn't easy when so many students are coming to play dodgeball. To do this, we partner with companies. In exchange for advertising space (on our website and on the back of t-shirts) they provide us with either a monetary donation or supply something we need for the tournament, such as dodgeballs or pizza. For a list of past and present sponsors, <a href="/sponsors">click here</a>.</p>

        <p>This year, we're restructuring our sponsorship system with 2 levels: Gold ($500), or Silver ($200), and we're counting on NAI and NASH students to help us, in exchange for free tickets to the tournament. For every $200 in sponsorships, you get a free ticket to the tournament! This credit carries over between players too. As an added bonus, if your team gets 2 Gold Sponsorships, we'll give your entire team free tickets!</p>

        <p>Here's how this works:
            <ol>
                <li>Login to your NA Google Drive and fill out <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/i3C4o8lfQH" target="_blank">this Google form</a>. This lets us make sure no one else has already asked this company.</li>
                <li>Give us a day. We'll get back to you as quickly as possible. It won't take more than a day.</li>

                <li>If you are approved to offer sponsorship, we'll send you a package with more information and useful NA Project Water tools.</li>
                <li>Get some free tickets!</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>This whole process only takes a day or two, and maybe a phone call to your uncle. If everyone does this, just imagine the difference we can make!</p>

        <p>FAQ: These tickets can be accepted by anyone who has registered for the tournament. If you aren't on a team, these free tickets won't expand the number of teams we can hold. However, we can give you a free ticket as a volunteer, and you'd get all the same benefits listed above. Instead of playing though, you'd help us run things :).</p>

        <p>If your team has already paid for NA Project Water tickets, you can receive reimbursement. That's something to mention when filling out the Google form!</p>
